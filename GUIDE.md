# User Guide

## How to add a new user request:

Request must be in the following JSON format: example.json

Go to Admin > Add a new user request (JSON) and upload the file

Wait as the API processes the request; once completed, you'll be redirected to a page with a JSON reply that includes the names of tasks created for the user. 

Navigate back to the home page and you'll see the email address for the user listed there.


## How to process user requests:

From the home page, click on an email address. Once the user page loads, you'll see a list of tasks designated for the user.

Each task instance has a name, some metadata below, and a button that triggers the task instance to run.

To process one of the tasks, click on that button ... and wait.

Once the task instance completes, you'll be redirected to a page with a JSON reply that includes metadata like cost and duration, and a message about the task status.

Back up and reload the user page and you'll see the updated metadata for the task.
